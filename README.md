# SSW567-Group2

SSW567 - Group 2 - How effective is ChatGPT in generating quality code for GitHub commits?

## Replicate Data Extraction and Scoring

In order to reproduce the team's methodology and results, a helper script called filter_and_score.py was written for ease of replication. Running the file will copy the code generated by ChatGPT that was used in the study, score them, and produce two csv files containing numeric score outputs and detailed score outputs. Errors in getting the number of prompts and scoring are marked "ERR"

The initial dataset was too large to upload to GitHub, but the filtered dataset containing links to the files used in the study can be found in filtered_big_file.csv

```bash
cd "Data Extraction"
python filter_and_score.py
```

## Testing

To test the Python scripts:

```bash
cd "Data Extraction"
cd files
cd tests
python run_tests.py
```
